# Breast_Cancer_Risk_Prediction

Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast with abnormalities multiply uncontrollably and form tumors that, if not treated, can spread throughout the body and cause death. Cancerous cells begin to develop within the milk-producing ducts or lobules of the breast. Cancer at stage 0 (in situ) is not potentially fatal. Cancer cells can spread to nearby breast tissue (invasion), leading to nodules or thickening. Invasive cancers can spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs (metastasis). Metastases can be deadly. 
In the 1990s, survival rates began to improve, when countries implemented early breast cancer detection programs associated with comprehensive treatment programs that included effective pharmacological treatments. In 2020, breast cancer was diagnosed in 2.3 million women worldwide, and 685,000 died from the disease. By the end of the same year, 7.8 million women who had been diagnosed with breast cancer in the previous five years were still alive, making it the most prevalent cancer in the world.
